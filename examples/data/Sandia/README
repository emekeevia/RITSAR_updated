This document describes the raw SAR data set. The raw data set
consists of two main files.

rvr.phs -- is the raw complex data. Each sample is a complex number (4 bytes,
two real integer bytes followed by two integer imaginary bytes). The data set 
has 1999 pulses and 1800 samples/pulse. Thus the file is 1999*1800*4 bytes long.
The file contains the data from pulse1, followed by pulse2 ... etc..

rvr.au2 -- is the auxillary info file containing the number of pulses, number of
samples/pulse, pointing vector for each pulse etc. The documentation for this 
file is a word document 'au2_filedefinition.doc'. The information in the file can be easily
read using the included matlab code 'get_au2.m'. The code returns a structure
with all the important parameters. ie file_info = get_au2('rvr.au2');

There is also a jpg file showing what the formed image should look like when it
is processed correctly.

Although the *.au2 can accommodate a variety of collections (bistatic, 
varying center frequencies... etc) this collection is quite basic.. Meaning
the center frequency is constant on each pulse and there are no additional
phase corrections needed on pulse-by-pulse basis...
