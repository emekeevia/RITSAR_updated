This code is not part of the RITSAR toolset.  This code has essentially been copied from Mehrdad Soumekh's spotlight processing algorithm, which is written in MATLAB, and has been translated to Python.  Also provided are copies of this code with parameters modified to match those given in the Carrera text for both the x-band and UHF scenarios.  The x-band file will likely give memory errors.  A short description as to why is given in the header for that code.
